Animal Shelter is a website that tracks all the animals by category and shows when they are adopted.

Epicodus Coursework Objectives
------------------------------

* Make a website for an animal shelter to categorize and list their animals by type. 
* They should be able to add an animal to the website, assign it as a cat, dog, bunny, etc and then list all of the animals for each type on the website. 
* If a user clicks on an animal it should remove the animal from that list and then assign it to a list that shows animals that have been adopted. 
* You should also create a factory to hold a method that can give a total number of animals in any particular list.
